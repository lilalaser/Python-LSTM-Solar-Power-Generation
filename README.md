# Python-LSTM-Solar-Power-Generation
This project explores how weather data (temperature, solar radiation, etc.) can be used to forecast solar power generation in Germany. Using open datasets from the Open Power System Data (OPSD) platform and weather records, an LSTM neural network is trained to predict short-term solar output.
